        Emulsion paints are characterized by their fast drying and hardening, and surfaces can be cleaned easily with water. Once applied, 
        enamel paints offer durability, good color retention, and alkali resistance. Emulsion paints are commonly used for interior walls, 
        ceilings and masonry work. What is emulsion paint used for? For the most part, emulsion paint is exclusively for interior walls and 
        ceilings. It's the most common type of interior paint. You can use emulsion paint on previously painted interior walls or newly 
        plastered walls Emulsion paints are ideal for ceilings and walls because it is thick and easy to apply. They are humidity â€“ resistant 
        and hence can be easily used in steamy rooms like kitchens and bathrooms.. Emulsion mostly refers to paint used for walls and ceilings.
        It's water-based with vinyl or acrylic added for durability. It comes in a range of finishes: gloss, satin, eggshell, silk, flat 
        matt or matt. The color of an emulsion (a- And b-values) is mainly determined by the dye type (red, green, blue) and concentration 
        (0 - 0.1 wt%). When we paint it is necessary to add some water for mixing the paint or good finish? Not necessary, but it helps to 
        make a spreadable consistency and makes your paint last longer because you use less. The finish looks the same, but can become flaky 
        if you use too much water. Emulsion paint is water-based with some chemicals to last longer, although you can typically remove it with 
        water and soap. Enamel paint is solvent-based, long-lasting paint. However, only a solvent can be used to remove it. The premium 
        emulsion is costlier than the tractor emulsion. It also gives a matt finish. Coverage ranges from 140-150. It is available in 1750+ 
        shades. This gives Rich Matte Finish and more smooth than tractor emulsion. There are three types of Emulsion Paint available in 
        market. Each and every type of Emulsion Paint finish has its own advantage. The matte Emulsion Paints helps in hiding the imperfection 
        on the walls. Vinyl soft sheen Emulsion Paint helps in offering longer durability. Washable paint is a type of emulsion formulated so 
        that it can be wiped or scrubbed to remove marks without damaging the paintwork, making it useful for high traffic areas which might 
        otherwise need regular repainting. Insufficient amount of emulsifier. Precipitation of water-soluble emulsifiers. pH disbalance (too 
        high a concentration of base or acid can make emulsifiers disfunctional) Emulsifier interaction (use of anionic and cationic 
        emulsifiers in the same product) Emulsion is a colloidal solution where both dispersed phase and dispersed medium are liquids. 
        Examples are: Milk, face cream,etc. Abstract. Emulsification is the process of dispersing two or more immiscible liquids together to 
        form a semistable mixture. In food applications, these two liquids generally consist of an organic (oil) phase and an aqueous (water) 
        phase that is stabilized by the addition of a food-grade emulsifier (surfactant). Emulsion paints are water-based paints with various 
        permanent substances like Alkyd resins, acrylic resin and epoxy as a binder. Oil-based paint is a type of paint that consists of 
        pigments suspended in the drying oil commonly linseed oil. There is no need for thinner emulsion paints.
