        Tool steel refers to a variety of carbon and alloy steels that are particularly well-suited to be made into tools. Their suitability 
        comes from their distinctive hardness, resistance to abrasion and deformation and their ability to hold a cutting edge at elevated 
        temperatures. As a result tool steels are suited for their use in the shaping of other materials. Tool steel can refer to a variety of 
        carbon and alloy steels which are commonly used to make tools. Tool steels are vastly different from steel used in consumer goods and 
        they are made on a much smaller scale. Strict quality procedures assure that a given grade of tool steel will perform a specific task 
        such as machining or perforating. Tool steel is generally used in a heat-treated state. Many high-carbon tool steels are also more 
        resistant to corrosion due to their higher ratios of elements such as vanadium and niobium. Tool steels are steels which are 
        manufactured under carefully controlled conditions with carbon content between 0.7% and 1.5% and low manganese content to reduce the 
        possibility of cracking during water quenching. Proper heat treating of these steels is important for adequate performance. High-load 
        applications such as punching stainless steel, spring steel and high-strength low-alloy require tool steels with a combination of shock
        resistance, wear resistance and high compressive strength. Tool steels are made in a number of grades for different applications. 
        Choice of grade depends on the edge temperature under expected use. This is an important determinant of both composition and required 
        heat treatment. Tool steels are also used for injection molding because resistance to abrasion is an important criterion for a mold 
        that will be used to produce hundreds of thousands of parts. The higher carbon grades are typically used for such applications as 
        stamping dies, metal cutting tools, etc... Tool steels are also used for injection molding because resistance to abrasion is an 
        important criterion for a mold that will be used to produce hundreds of thousands of parts. The higher carbon grades are typically 
        used for such applications as stamping dies, metal cutting tools, etc...This group contains low-cost high carbon steels with high 
        hardness. The price factor makes it the most widely used amongst tool steels.However, fragility is a side-effect of the W-gradeâ€™s 
        hardness. Also, they are not suitable for working at elevated temperatures.The name derives from the fact that all steels in this 
        group are water quenched. Water quenching may result in cracks and warping more often than oil quenching or air hardening. This is 
        also why the sales, although still leading, have been decreasing compared to other grades.
