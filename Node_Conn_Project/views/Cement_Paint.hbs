        paint and is applied to either exterior or interior including brick work and concrete. It is used for painting exterior wall surface 
        mainly for preventing water penetration amd reductions of dirt collection. It is suitable for coating concrete as well as decorating 
        indoor and outdoor walls. Cement paint gives very good protection to all kinds of masonry surfaces from Ultraviolet rays present in 
        sunrays. It gives very good protection from severe climatic conditions like rain, heat, water, humidity, salt atmosphere near 
        sea-shores, to all types of cemented walls, surfaces. The Cement Paint is made with white Portland cement and specific ingredients 
        that make it simple to apply and resist water. Concrete waterproof cement paint is used mostly on outside walls to avoid water and 
        fungus from entering the inside walls and causing damage. The best kind of paint to use on a concrete floor is epoxy paint because 
        of its durability. You can also use latex paint, though it won't hold up as well as epoxy. Acrylic paint also works well, especially 
        for exterior concrete walls as it can withstand harsh weather. Concrete waterproof cement paint is used especially on the exterior 
        walls to prevent the entry of water and mould, which causes damage to the interior walls. Waterproof cement paints are also used as

        staining and humidity. Take one volume of water and two volumes of cement paint in a clean container. Mix it thoroughly and make a 
        uniform paste. Then, add one more volume of water to get brushable consistency. Always mix cement paint to water (and not water to 
        cement paint) while making the wet paint. Rust-Oleum Specialty Cement Paint is a faux finish that provides the natural look and feel 
        of cement. Cement Paint transforms any object to look as if it is made of cement without the weight or hassle of cement. Concrete 
        paints and stains help to mask surface discoloration and signs of wear and tear and they extend the life of concrete by preventing 
        further damage. Coating a concrete surface with paint can also make for easier cleaning and maintenance. Most brands suggest that you 
        apply a new coat every 3â€“5 years, depending on use. Some may last much longer if the area is protected from the elements or seldom 
        tread upon. Cement paints are covered under Powder Paints which are used for exterior cemented walls, all types of masonry surfaces
