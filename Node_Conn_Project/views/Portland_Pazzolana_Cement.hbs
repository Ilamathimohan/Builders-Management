        Pozzolana is a volcanic powder found in Italy near Vesuvius. A pozzolanic material can be a natural or artificial which contains 
        silica and aluminous in a reactive form. This materials usually doesnt posses any cementitious properties, but when it is mixed with 
        water or moisture or lime to undergo reaction with calcium hydroxide to form compounds possessing cement properties. There are two 
        types of Pozzolana materials  they are -  Artificial pozzolana(Fly ash, silica fume, rice husk, blast furnace slag) and Natural 
        pozzolana(Manufacture of Portland pozzolana cement) . The primary raw materials used for this cement manufacture  are limestone 
        (CaCO2) and clay (SiO2,AI2,O3,Fe2O3). Rocks are loaded into trucks and transported to the crushers, where the crushed into fine 
        particles.  Fine particles of clay and limestone are fed into the air-swept ball mills in desired proportions as per requirement 
        and mixed very well before it is sent to silos for storing.  This mixture is then pre-heated upto 800-1000c where calcinations of 
        CACO3 to CaO takes place.  The pre heated mixture is then sent into kiln where the mixture is heated to 1450C in rotary Kiln. 
        The modules formed from the burning process called clinker. The clinker is cooled by a rotary cooler.  This clinker is now mixed 
        with gypsum and pozzolana materials in the required proportion and thus the Portland Pozzolana Cement is obtained.  Uses of Portland 
        Pozzolana Cement are Used in hydraulic structures, marine structures, construction near the sea shore, dam construction etcâ€¦ , Used 
        in pre-stressed and post-tensioned concrete members, Used in masonry mortars and plastering,  As it gives better surface finish, it 
        is used in decorative and art structures, Used in manufacture of precast sewage pipes,  Used under harsh concreting conditions. PPC 
        is a type of blended cement. It consists of 15-35% pozzolanic material, 4% gypsum and the rest is clinker. PPC as per BIS code is 
        equivalent to that of 33 grade. The Portland Pozzolana Cement is a kind of Blended Cement which is produced by either inter-grinding 
        of OPC clinker along with gypsum and pozzolanic materials in certain proportions or grinding the OPC clinker, gypsum and Pozzolanic 
        materials separately and thoroughly blending them in certain proportions. The Cement mortar that is prepared in 1: 3 proportions using 
        standard sand (as per IS:650) and tested at standard laboratory conditions and should gain the compressive strength of not less than 
        33 MPa after 28 days, Produces less heat of hydration and offers resistance to the attack of aggressive waters.
