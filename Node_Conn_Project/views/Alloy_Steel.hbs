        Alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with a variety of elements in total amounts between 1.0% and 50% by weight to improve its 
        mechanical properties. Alloy steels are broken down into two groups: low alloy steels and high alloy steels. The difference between 
        the two is disputed. Smith and Hashemi define the difference at 4.0%, while Degarmo, et al., define it at 8.0%.[1][2] Most commonly, 
        the phrase "alloy steel" refers to low-alloy steels. Strictly speaking, every steel is an alloy, but not all steels are called "alloy 
        steels". The simplest steels are iron (Fe) alloyed with carbon (C) (about 0.1% to 1%, depending on type) and nothing else (excepting 
        negligible traces via slight impurities); these are called carbon steels. However, the term "alloy steel" is the standard term 
        referring to steels with other alloying elements added deliberately in addition to the carbon. Common alloyants include manganese 
        (the most common one), nickel, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, silicon, and boron. Less common alloyants include aluminium, cobalt, 
        copper, cerium, niobium, titanium, tungsten, tin, zinc, lead, and zirconium. The following is a range of improved properties in alloy 
        steels (as compared to carbon steels): strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, hardenability, and hot 
        hardness. To achieve some of these improved properties the metal may require heat treating. Although alloy steels have been made for 
        centuries, their metallurgy was not well understood until the advancing chemical science of the nineteenth century revealed their 
        compositions. Alloy steels from earlier times were expensive luxuries made on the model of "secret recipes" and forged into such 
        tools as knives and swords. Modern alloy steels of the machine age were developed as improved tool steels and as newly available 
        stainless steels. Today alloy steels find uses in a wide array of applications, from everyday hand tools and flatware to highly 
        demanding applications such as in the turbine blades of jet engines and in nuclear reactors. Because of the ferromagnetic properties 
        of iron, some steel alloys find important applications where their responses to magnetism are very important, including in electric 
        motors and in transformers.
