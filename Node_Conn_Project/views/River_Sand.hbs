        This River Sand can also be said as Natural Sand. River sand falls under the fine quality of construction sands which is found near
        river banks and streams. This sand is white-grey and is one of the fine graded sands used in the construction of buildings. They are
        mainly used in concrete and masonry work. They can also be used for RCC, plastering, and much other brick or block works. This sand 
        consists of a smoother texture and a better shape of grains. The river or natural sand demands very less water. The moisture which is
        trapped between these particles serves good for various concrete purposes. A medium quality river sand consists of 5 to 20% of silt 
        content in them. River sand since naturally obtained is cheaper. This types of sand used in construction contains silica content in
        them. Therefore, it is necessary to check for the amount of silica present and ensure it is below 5%, before using it for construction.
        Rivers have long been a source of construction materials such as sand and gravel. Sand is a very important material and is needed by the 
        community on a large scale, for example a mixture of reinforced concrete cement aggregates for the construction of modern buildings, of 
        roads, bridges, dams, housing, and so on. River Sand is a natural sand that is made from weathering or erosion processes, unlike other 
        sands that are made from crushing rock. River Sand can vary in gradation but is typically coarse sand. River Sand is a natural sand that

        quarry. It is manufactured by quarry of granite stones, Crushing rocks, or larger aggregate pieces into sand size particles in a 
        factory or quarry. But river sand is naturally available and extracted from the riverbanks or river beds. Mined from river beds, 
        river sand has a very fine consistency and is therefore one of the most widely used aggregates in construction. It's most commonly 
        mixed with cement to create a concrete like mixture which can be used for various construction purposes. Rub the sample of the sand 
        with wet palms. Good clean sand will not stick to the hand, whereas sand with clay will stick and change the colour of the palm. 
        Such sand contains clay and silt particle.
