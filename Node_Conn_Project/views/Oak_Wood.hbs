        When used to form the frame of a building, Oak, is easy and quick to work with allowing you to easily put your structure together. 
        Oak wood is great for trusses, beams and pillars and is particularly useful when restoring old barns, building house extensions and 
        adding a solid structure to your garden. Oak is commonly used for furniture, joinery, flooring, panelling, decking and veneers. 
        Advantages: durable, long-lasting wood. attractive wood grain. Oak is the strongest, most durable timber we use. It is rich in tannins 
        making it extremely durable and resistant to decay and insect attack, and if kept dry oak frame constructions have frequently lasted 
        over 500 years. North America has the most, with around 90 species being found there. Oak wood has been used as a hardwood timber for 
        thousands of years, yet it takes up to 150 years before the wood from an oak tree can be used for construction. Modern uses for oak 
        wood include homewares, flooring, wine barrels and firewood. Oak wood is one of the most commonly used types of hardwood. It has a 
        distinct grain finish and is used in a variety of applications. Generally acknowledged as the hardest wood, lignum vitae (Guaiacum 
        sanctum and Guaiacum officinale) measures in at 4,500 pounds-force (lbf) on the Janka scale. That's more than twice as hard as Osage 
        orange (one of the hardest domestic woods) at 2,040 lbf and more than three times harder than red oak at 1,290 lbf. Compared to other 
        wood species, oak is quite dense, making it strong, heavy and durable. Oak is also remarkably water, insect and fungi resistant. When 
        used to form the frame of a building, Oak, is easy and quick to work with allowing you to easily put your structure together. Oak wood 
        is great for trusses, beams and pillars and is particularly useful when restoring old barns, building house extensions and adding a 
        solid structure to your garden. Oakwood is a popular wood often used for furniture and flooring. It's highly durable, flexible, and 
        looks fantastic, whether stained or with a clear, natural finish. It's also an efficient wood to burn because of its high British 
        Thermal Unit (BTU). As a hardwood, oak has a high level of water resistance as its dense, non – porous texture resists water 
        absorption, making it ideal for exterior uses without the need for waterproof chemicals being applied. Oak can be expensive to buy, 
        but this is offset by its many strengths. As oak is a slow growing wood compared to many others, it takes a long time to reach 
        maturity, when it can be felled and used for timber. As it is slow to produce, this naturally drives up the cost. Oak, sweet chestnut, 
        Western red cedar and Douglas fir are the woods most commonly associated with corrosion of metals in contact with them under damp 
        conditions. White Oak falls at a 6 (1360) on the Janka Hardness Scale. It is a hard and heavy wood, but still maintains good 
        workability, making it a popular choice for structural use, such as square timber posts. Oak is one of the strongest and the hardest 
        woods available. Its tough characteristic makes it ideal for the structure of buildings and it is a favourite for builders. This wood 
        is high quality, resistant to moisture, and has a unique appearance that adds character to a home. Regardless of whether you're 
        building a wall, fence, pillar, or the entire structural framework of a house, an oak beam is the best material to use. Oakwood can 
        be used for any project or building application. This means very little of the wood is wasted. You'll also save money in the process. 
        The lumber industry uses a scale called the Janka Rating System. This scale measures and ranks the relative hardness of wood. Hickory 
        is the hardest, commercially available common wood. Next in line are pecan, hard maple and white oak. Oak wood is prized in furniture 
        making as well as in flooring and cabinetry because of its durability, workability, and natural beauty. White oak has some water 
        resistance to it, so it has historically been the choice for crafting things like wine barrels and boats. While most of the oak tree's 
        roots grow downward in search of water and minerals, some oak roots also grow upward into very rich soil near the surface. Strong 
        roots make for a strong tree. It's the “mighty oak” for good reason!
