        Low heat cement is a special tailored cement which generates low heat of hydration during setting. It is manufactured by modifying 
        the chemical composition of normal Portland cement. In this article we discuss about the composition, properties, characteristics, 
        uses and advantages of low heat cement. The  Composition Of Low Heat Cement is This special type of cement is same as that of normal 
        Portland cement, with some percentage changes in the chemical compositions. This cement contains low percentage (5%) of tricalcium 
        aluminate (C3A) and higher percentage (46%) of dicalcium silicate (C2S). The Characteristics Of Low Heat Cement are Characteristics 
        of Low Heat Cement are- Low heat of hydration is 20% lesser than that of OPC cement, The amount of water required for hydration is low,
        High workability is obtained as the concrete is fluidly in nature, Good volume stabilisation, Initial strength is low but the high 
        growth rate of final strength, More high technical strength of concrete , Excellent impact erosion, Excellent wear resistance, Lower 
        temperature upward value of heat insulation, Super-high performance of chemical corrosion resistance, Excellent resistance to drying 
        shrinkage, Good resistance to rupture.  Low Heat Cement is compatible with Chemical Admixtures for Concrete, Supplementary Cementitious
        Materials for Use with Portland cement: Fly ash, Slag - ground granulated Iron blast-furnace, Amorphous silica. The advantges of the low
        heat cement are -	Assists in minimising the potential for thermal cracking in thick concrete sections, Improvised durability 
        performance, Excellent performances such as high final strength, sulphate corrosion resistance, good lasting properties, good 
        resistance to rupture,anti-seepage. Low Heat Cement is specially blended to provide a lower heat of hydration in concrete. 
        This unique attribute makes it ideal for mass concrete pours where the rate of temperature rise and the maximum temperature achieved 
        must be controlled in order to reduce the risk of thermal cracking. Low heat cement is one of the types of Portland cement. It is 
        specially made cement that generates low heat of hydration during the time of the setting process of construction. Low heat is in the 
        context of low heat of hydration. Low heat cement is developed in 1930 in the US for the construction of large gravity dams.It is 
        mainly used cement for the mass concrete construction such as dams, roads, factory floors, etc. where more heat generation due to 
        hydration raises the temperature where low heat cement plays the role to balance it.
