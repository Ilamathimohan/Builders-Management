        M-sand stands for Manufactured sand and is one of the types of sand used in construction in India. This type of construction sand is
        manufactured in the factory. It can be used as a substitute for river sand for concrete construction. Manufactured sand has been used
        ever since the demand for good quality sand has increased rapidly. This type of construction sand is prepared by crushing hard granite
        and hence it reduces transportation costs of bringing sand from river beds. It contains particles of angular nature which increases
        the strength of concrete. These angular particles present in the sand increases its water demand. This water demand can be compensated
        by adding cement content. Since it is artificially manufactured, it contains zero silt content. There are no oversized materials found
        in these types of construction sand. This is a type of construction sands that is easily available too. Since it manufactured and not
        natural, it can be free from several impurities and the sizes of the sand grains can be controlled as desired which suits each 
        purpose. Since they are manufactured in a controlled environment, there is very little probability of adulteration of this sand and
        there is better control over the manufacturing quality of the M-sand. The M-sand provides good durability and imparts high strength
        to concrete. It is very economical and reduces construction defects. M sand is a form of artificial sand, manufactured by crushing
        large hard stones, mainly rocks or granite, into fine particles, which is then washed and finely graded. It is widely used as a substitute
        for river sand for construction purposes, mostly in the production of concrete and mortar mix. What is the use of M sand?
        Manufactured sand or M-sand is a substitute of river sand, used in construction industry mainly for concrete production and mortar
        mix. This is mainly crushed fine aggregate produced from a source material with suitable strength, durability and shape 
        characteristics. M-sand is good for construction as it creates durable, workable, and high-strength concrete. Its disadvantages include
        the coarse texture and high levels of micro-fine particles. However, M-sand is sustainable, economical, and efficient, so most 
        construction companies are using it today. Usage of M sand reduces or prevents dredging of river beds. Dredging leads to environmental 
        disasters as discussed earlier, i.e. groundwater depletion, erosion of soil on land, etc. Thus, manufactured sand or crushed sand is 
        much eco-friendlier than river sand.
