        Light-gauge steel (also known as cold-formed steel and cold-rolled steel) is a cold-formed material that is used to make construction 
        processes smoother and products stronger. It does not deteriorate, like wood. It is not bulky, like structural steel. It is not heavy, 
        like concrete. The Disadvantages of using Light Gauge Steel Frame Load Bearing. Light gauge steel frame load-bearing is made with a 
        non-combustible material. Despite this, it does need to be protected from fire with properly fire-rated boarding, as it will lose its 
        strength in a fire. Light-gauge steel sections are also known as cold formed steel sections. These sections are made from thin sheets 
        of uniform thickness without the application of heat. The thickness of the sheet used is generally between 1 mm and 8 mm. The pins are 
        manufactured from AISI 1566 steel, heat-treated to a Rockwell C Hardness between 52 and 56, and have a minimum tensile strength of 
        240,000 psi and a bending yield strength of 250 ksi. The light gauge steel frame is developed without the use of heat through the 
        cold-formed process (at room temperatures), which allows steel manufacturers to produce a lightweight but high tensile steel sheets. 
        These steel sheets are made by processing metallic scrap and then undergoing a cold-formed process. It is something completely 
        different, and if you have ever worked with it before, you know that there is a practically endless list of benefits. Let’s look 
        further into this wonder material and how iSPAN Systems’ light-gauge steel structural solutions can benefit you on your next project.
        The Benefits of the Light Gauge Steel is Results in fewer plan changes and costly mistakes since materials are prefabricated, 
        Environmentally friendly choice using recyclable materials, Each detail is planned prior to construction. Light Gauge Steel Frame is a 
        construction technology that uses cold-formed steel as the primary construction material. It can be used for roof systems, floor 
        systems, wall systems, roof panels, decks as well as the entire building. Cold-formed steel (CFS) is fast becoming the material of 
        choice for low to mid-rise construction in India due to its inherent advantages such as high strength to weight ratio, lightweight, 
        easy to handle, cost effective, vermin resistant, dimensionally constant and can be fabricated with ease to a wide range of profiles 
        and sizes with nearly no material wastage not to mention its sustainable nature whose material properties do not change with time.
