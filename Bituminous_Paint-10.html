        Bituminous paints are special paints used in construction for waterproofing, corrosion resistance, and damp proofing applications for 
        different structural elements. It is made out of bitumen or coal tar dissolved in mineral spirit or naphtha, applied to structure 
        either in liquid or semi-liquid form. The important properties of bituminous paints are.Bituminous paints can be modified using 
        polyurethane or acrylic polymer materials to increase their durability and flexibility. Bituminous paints are alkaline-resistant.
        Bituminous paints have good adhesive properties to act as an excellent barrier against air and moisture penetration.Bituminous paint 
        is strong, waterproof, durable, and can resist harsh manufacturing chemicals and UV light.Bituminous paint protects the surfaces from 
        rusting.Bituminous paint is available in 1l, 2.5l, 5l, 25l and its coverage per liter is dependent on the porosity of the surface.The 
        coverage of bituminous paint on metal and smooth surfaces is generally 10 sqm per liter.Bituminous paint is a ready-to-use product 
        that does not require thinning and is applied using a brush or spray. The primary applications of bituminous paint in the construction 
        industry are.Bituminous paint is applied to substrates, iron, steel, metal structures, castings, asbestos cement sheeting, and 
        structural concrete surfaces.Bituminous paint can be used to coat ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and other construction 
        materials that are exposed to marine environments.It is a flexible coating solution that can be applied below and above the ground. 
        They are economical, fast-drying, and easy to use. The performance of bituminous paint is dependent on how well the surface is prepared.
        Before the application of bituminous paint on any surface, it should be made sure that the surface is clean and dry. It must be free 
        from dirt, grease, rust, or any other contaminants. In addition, existing or loose paints on the surface must be removed.Before 
        painting metal surfaces, they must be cleaned thoroughly using a wire brush or sandpaper. Shot blasting or sanding machines can be 
        used to clean large metal surfaces.For the surfaces exposed to harsh marine environments, an anti-corrosive primer must be initially 
        applied before bituminous painting.The paint must be applied evenly on the entire surface in as many coats as required. Allow 30 
        minutes of drying time between coats. Leave for seven days to fully cure before backfilling. Bituminous paints are commonly used in 
        construction for waterproofing, corrosion resistance, and damp proofing applications for different structural elements. Bituminous 
        paint is applied to substrates, iron, steel, metal structures, castings, asbestos cement sheeting, and structural concrete surfaces

        either in liquid or semi-liquid form What is bitumen paint used for? Bitumen paint is suited to many different applications because of 
        its weatherproofing, corrosion resistance and adhesive properties. It is primarily used as a protective coating for buildings, 
        structures and items constructed from iron, steel, concrete, masonry and wood.
