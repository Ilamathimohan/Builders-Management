        Pit sand is a types of sand used in construction that is best used for constructing buildings due to its superior binding property.
        It is coarse sand that is found 2-3 meters under the ground. It is obtained naturally from deep pits. It consists of rough, sharp, 
        angular, and coarse grains that provide excellent binding properties. They appear in red-orange due to the presence of iron-oxide. 
        The grains of this construction sands is free from salts and hence they don't easily react with the moisture present in the atmosphere.
        Due to this property, they provide a strong and rigid building. Pit sand is a natural and coarse type of sand that is excavated by
        digging 2-3 m below the ground. due to the presence of iron oxide around the grains It colour will be reddish orange. These sand 
        grains are free of salts, so they do not react with the humidity present in the atmosphere. The sand i.e. procured forming a pit,
        by excavating normally between 1 meter to 8 meters beneath the earth's surface is termed as pit sand. The pit sand particles are 
        usually angular in shape with a rough surface and sharp edge as compared to the river sand. Due to the weathering action with the
        water, river sand particles are mostly round in shape with a smooth edge. The pit sand contains more coarse grain size particles by
        percentage, which makes them the most suitable type of sand for concrete work. However, by sieving and grading, you can use them for
        all the general-purpose in the construction work. The pit sand does not contain any marine impurities like seashells, chemical salts, 
        silt deposits, which are more common in the river or sea sand. Sometimes you may find them associated with the clay materials, or some
        organic impurities which can be removed effectively by sieving and washing them as said earlier. The pit sand is usually found in the 
        regions having more quartz and sandstones, which gets eroded slowly forming the deposits of the sand layer.
