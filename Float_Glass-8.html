        Float glass is manufactured using a melt process, where recycled glass, silica sand, lime, potash and soda are melted in a furnace 
        and floated onto a bed of molten tin. The molten mass solidifies slowly while flowing over the bed of molten tin, after which it is 
        annealed to remove stresses induced during the cooling process. Annealing also allows the glass to reach a more stable state resulting 
        in a higher density and higher refractive index. Reflective glasses are also available for applications where light transmittance is an
        important design factor. These glasses have a metallic coating applied during manufacture through two different methods. Pyrolytic 
        processes include using a semi-conducted metal oxide coating during manufacture, and magnetron processes use one or more metal oxide 
        coatings. These coatings are applied in a vacuum in the inner sides of the glass panes. Float glass is used for smaller windows in 
        domestic housing, whereas larger windows are made from toughened glasses. Glass is used for windows for both aesthetic and functional 
        purposes, allowing the occupants to see out and at the same time allowing light in. Glazing Float glass is becoming more and more 
        popular in commercial applications. It allows structures to be constructed and gives the impression of being outside with the benefits 
        of being inside protected from the elements (except the sun).Glass is also playing an increasing role in buildings where it provides an 
        attractive and easy to maintain exterior surface. It should be noted that most glass used for this application is subject to a post heat 
        treatment toughening process before use.In an era when a lot of attention is being shone on environmentally friendly practices in the 
        workplace and in domestic settings, considering the materials used in construction for large commercial buildings is key.Based on its 
        transparency, hardness and ease of cleaning, glass is often used for display cases in retail outlets and countertops. As already 
        mentioned, a major advantage of float glass is its completely even surface. In contrast to previous manufacturing processes, glass 
        can be produced in the float process, which allows a clear, undistorted view. Other properties of float glass: robust against scratches.
        Laminated glass is among the most effective types of glass used in building construction. In order to manufacture laminated glass, two 
        plies of normal glass are usually bonded together (strongly) with interlayers to form strong, permanent bonds. There are two types of 
        glass made by the float process, clear glass and tinted glass. Most of the flat glass made by the float process is clear glass. Float 
        glass can break due to excessive thermal stresses. Thermal breakage occurs due to uneven heating of glass. The uneven heating can be 
        caused by solar irradiance or other heat sources. For high rise buildings float glass should not be used in exteriors as it may break 
        due to high wind loads. In the float glass process, the ingredients (silica, lime, soda, etc.) are first blended with cullet (recycled 
        broken glass) and then heated in a furnace to around 1600Â°C to form molten glass. The molten glass is then fed onto the top of a molten 
        tin bath. The glass can be cut, drilled into and polished without the risk of internal stresses that would cause it to shatter. Annealed 
        Glass offers no safety features, it breaks into random shards that can cause serious injury. Used for walls and partitions, laminated 
        glass is common in high security buildings, businesses, and law enforcement vehicles. While transparent, laminated glass reinforces the 
        safety of homes, offices, and drivers worldwide. The extra layer of plastic can be tinted or clear and helps with soundproofing.
