        shatterproof glass - A type of glass made with plates of plastic or resin or some other material which is induced between two sheets 
        of glass and hence prevents it from shattering.  If the shatterproof glass breaks, then instead of spreading in sharp, jagged glass 
        pieces, the glass cracks in the shape of a spider web, but actually doesn’t break. This blog covers the reasons for installing 
        shatterproof glass.Advantages of Installing Shatterproof Glass in Buildings Shatterproof glass installation provides numerous benefits 
        to residential and commercial establishments. Check out some of the following advantages of installing shatterproof glass in buildings.
        The traditional standard glass is easily breakable and you know well what happens afterward. That glass is spread into large sharp 
        pieces that can severely harm humans. A basketball or a golf ball can easily put such damage to your window that can lead to any 
        damage.Using shatter-resistant windows, you don’t have to worry about any breakage or hazard. The robust thermoplastic interlayer 
        in such glass types is strong enough to withstand impacts more lethal than a basketball or a golf ball.For security purposes, 
        shatter-resistant glass is the best. The shatterproof glass protects your home or building from any break-ins or burglary attempts. 
        The glass is capable enough to hold a forced entry for four minutes according to its strength. Such extra time is enough to retaliate 
        against the intruder and authorities to arrive at the scene.Living in a busy street or having an office in a crowded part of the city 
        with extreme noise? No issues! The thermoplastic interlayer between the shatter-resistant glass also acts as a soundproof material. 
        Not completely, but up to some extent, they block the outside sound.Install the shatterproof glass in your building and make your room 
        a quiet and peaceful place. You will notice a notable reduction in the noise coming your way. In other words, it doesn't break into 
        sharp pieces in the event of destruction. Manufacturing shatterproof glass involves the addition of a plastic polyvinyl butyral resin 
        to prevent it from forming sharp pieces. It's commonly used in windows, floors, and skylights. Shatterproof windows have proven to be 
        a great asset when a burglar is attempting to break into a home. Unlike traditional windows, shatterproof windows prevent burglars 
        from smashing exterior windows and gaining easy access to homes. Often labeled as shatterproof glass but most certainly still 
        breakable, laminated products are produced using glass combined with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) or resin interlayer providing a 
        reinforced glass much like the glass used in car windshields that will remain intact upon impact. Laminated glass is among the most 
        effective types of glass used in building construction. In order to manufacture laminated glass, two plies of normal glass are usually 
        bonded together (strongly) with interlayers to form strong, permanent bonds.
