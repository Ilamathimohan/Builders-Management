        Burnt clay bricks are also known as common bricks because they are the most abundant brick type in modern construction. These bricks 
        are used in columns, walls, foundations, and more with a wide variety of purposes. When building walls, the burnt clay bricks require 
        plastering or rendering with mortar to help improve the bricksâ€™ strength, water resistance, and insulating ability. These bricks are 
        split into four different class categories based on quality. Fourth-class bricks are over-burnt, irregular in shape, and commonly 
        broken down for use as an aggregate. Third-class bricks are poor-quality materials that should only be used for temporary structures. 
        Second-class bricks are of moderate quality, though they have an irregular shape, rough surface, and might have hair-thin cracks. 
        First-class bricks are the best of the burnt clay brick classifications. These high-quality bricks have a standard shape, smooth 
        surface, and increased durability and strength. Burnt clay bricks are very old building material found in many of the ancient 
        structures of the world. Burnt clay bricks are the classic form of brick, created by pressing wet clay into molds, then drying and 
        firing in kilns. In appearance, these bricks are solid blocks of hardened clay, usually reddish. Burnt clay bricks are typically sold 
        in four classes. First-class burnt-clay bricks are the best, offering the best quality and strength. These high-grade burnt clay 
        bricks have no noticeable flaws and cost more than lower classes. When burnt clay bricks are used in walls, they require plastering 
        or rendering with mortar. Uses for burnt clay bricks include masonry walls, foundations, and columns. Clay brick is a product of 
        mother earth, and after use, can be crushed and returned to earth, or recycled. Not only do recycled clay bricks contribute towards 
        embodied energy savings, they also extend the life cycle of this material. Clay bricks vary in compressive strength due to the 
        differing qualities of raw materials and the method of firing. The compressive strengths of clay bricks can vary from 3.5MPa for NFP, 
        to greater than 50MPa for face brick extra. Clay brick products for load-bearing designs can be provided according to tolerances and 
        strength. Clay bricks are rendered water resistant making them impervious to all forms of weather conditions. They comprise of a fine 
        capillary pore system which has the ability to absorb moisture from rain or water vapour and then release it back into the atmosphere 
        again as quickly.
