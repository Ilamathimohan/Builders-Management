        Spruce is extremely versatile and can be used as roundwood, sawn timber, laminated timber or as veneer. As a material in building and 
        civil engineering, as well as in interior design, spruce has a significant role to play. Its lightweight properties and even texture 
        makes spruce wood suitable for light construction and framing work. Its strength makes it quite suitable for low-stress situations. 
        For use in wet conditions and in situations where it comes in contact with soil, treated lumber is the ideal selection. Spruce wood 
        is used both as a construction material and to generate energy. It is commercially available in round logs, as veneer and in the form 
        of glued structural elements. Due to its good workability and high availability, it is the most widely used construction timber in 
        Europe. Spruce, which is our most important wood for construction timber, falls into the lowest durability category in contact with 
        the ground. Softwoods are frequently used as building materials. Examples of softwood trees are cedar, Douglas fir, juniper, pine, 
        redwood, spruce, and yew. Hardwood refers to wood from broad-leaved trees such as oak, ash or beech. Spruce trees are prone to 
        numerous needle, branch and root diseases, including spruce needle rust, needle blight, cytospora canker, root rot and the parasitic 
        Eastern spruce dwarf mistletoe. Framing. Besides Doug-fir, spruce pine fur is also a great material for house framing. This is because 
        it is relatively strong and therefore robust enough to hold the house and the roof together. Besides, SPF has excellent nail holding 
        properties and so, easily usable. Standard spruce plywood is an essential component in home repair, construction, and remodeling 
        projects. While it does contain wood knots, these are cosmetic only and do not affect strength and performance. This wood is suitable 
        for use in walls and is strong enough to serve as roofing or flooring plywood. Spruce wood is also very popular in furniture making 
        because it is very lightweight. But it also works well as ceiling cladding, flooring, doors, or window casings. Pine is weaker than 
        spruce, but it contains high amount of resins which ensure durability of created products. Spruce has creamy-white lumber. Thanks to 
        its excellent tonal quality, spruce is often used for the manufacture of music instruments such as guitars and violins. Treatment with
        chemical preservatives and waterproofing compounds greatly increase spruce's resistance to deterioration. Under natural weathering 
        conditions spruce's creamy white color slowly changes to a light silver. What kind of trees last the longest? A typical pine, fir or 
        spruce tree should last roughly five weeks when maintained properly, though they age in different ways, depending on the type of tree 
        and environmental factors. Rot Resistance: The heartwood is rated as moderate to low in decay resistance. Workability: Overall, Spruce 
        Pine works fairly well with most tools, though the resin can gum up tools and clog sandpaper. Spruce Pine glues and finishes well.
