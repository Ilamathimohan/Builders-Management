        Ordinary Portland Cement(OPC) is the most widely used cement in the construction world. It is the basic ingredient for producing 
        concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grouts. Ordinary Portland Cement is graded based on its strength. The grade indicates the 
        compressive. Physical Properties of OPC Cement-Physical requirements other than compressive strength of cement, that are required to 
        be checked before approving the cement for use are as follows:Fineness When tested for fineness by Blaine’s air permeability method, 
        the specific surface of cement shall not be less than 225 m2/kg. This is applicable to all grades of cement. oundness When tested by
        ‘Le-Chatelier’ method, unaerated cement shall not have an expansion of more than 10mm. When tested by Autoclave test, unaerated cement 
        shall not have an expansion of more than 0.8 percent. This is applicable to all grades of cement.Setting Time When tested by Vicat 
        apparatus method, the setting time of cement shall conform to the following requirement- Initial setting time - not less than 30 mins, 
        Final setting time - not less than 600 mins. The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of Ordinary Portland Cement are: 
        Argillaceous or silicates of alumina in the form of clays and shales, Calcareous or calcium carbonate, in the form of limestone, chalk 
        and marl which is a mixture of clay and calcium carbonate. The ingredients are mixed in the proportion of about two parts of calcareous 
        materials to one part of argillaceous materials and then crushed and ground in ball mills in a dry state or mixed in wet state. The dry 
        powder or the wet slurry is then burnt in a rotary kiln at a temperature between 1400 degree C to 1500 degree C. the clinker obtained from 
        the kiln is first cooled and then passed on to ball mills where gypsum is added and it is ground to the requisite fineness according to 
        the class of product. In the first step of the manufacture of cement, the raw materials are crushed and grinded into small suitable 
        size particles. There are 3 type of manufacture process of cement Dry Process, Wet Process, Semi wet Process Crushing and grinding 
        process varies depending upon the type of manufacturing process. For dry process the raw materials are dried up before crushing.
