        Sulphate Resisting Cement is a type of Portland Cement in which the amount of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) is restricted to lower than 
        5% and (2C 3A +C4AF) lower than 25%, which reduces the formation of sulphate salts. The reduction of sulphate salts lowers the 
        possibility of sulphate attack on the concrete. In this article we study about the composition, properties, characteristics, uses, 
        advantages and disadvantages of sulphate resisting cement. The Composition of Sulphate Resisting Cement are Due to very low range of 
        tricalcium aluminate in sulphate resisting cement, a very small quantity of calcium aluminate is formed on hydration. The formation 
        of calcium sulpho- aluminates which formed due to reaction of calcium sulpho-aluminates which formed due to reaction of calcium 
        sulpho-aluminate and sulphate salts is considerably reduced with use of sulphate resisting cement. The sulphate aluminates are highly 
        expansive in nature and cause maximum damage to the concrete. The Characteristics of Sulphate Resisting Cement are -This cement 
        provides maximum resistance to chloride ions - minimising the risk of corrosion of reinforced steel, It also provides high level of 
        concrete performance and structural integrity in highly aggressive sulphate and acidic environments,  It also has increased workability
        and pumpability,  This cement has significantly improved later-age concrete strengths. The Uses of Sulphate Resisting Cement are- 
        Sulphate Resisting Cement is recommended for following type of constructions- Foundations, Piling works, Construction in contact with 
        soils or ground water having more than 0.2% or 0.3 % g/l sulphate salts respectively, Concrete surfaces subjected to alternate wetting 
        and drying such as bridge piers, concrete surface in tidal zone, apron etc.., Effluent treatment plans,  Chimney, cooling towers, 
        Coastal protective works such as sea walls, break waters, tetrapods etc.,Building near seacoast, Chemical industries, water storage, 
        sumps, drainage works, Suitable for underground works where Sulphate is present in the Soil and water. Sulphate Resistant Cement (SRC) 
        is a blended cement designed to improve the performance of concrete in the event of a sulphate attack. It also provides improved 
        durability for concrete in most aggressive environments, reducing the risk of deterioration of the structure. Sulphate resisting 
        Cement has the property of resistance to mineralized water containing sulphates and is mainly used in underwater construction. This 
        kind of cement increases the durability of concrete when subjected to aggressive environmental conditions reducing the risk of 
        deterioration and structural failure. SRPC is made by fusing together at high temperatures a precisely controlled blend of very finely 
        ground limestone, shale, and iron oxide to form cement clinker. A small quantity of gypsum is added to this clinker before grinding to 
        produce the final fine powder – Sulfate-resisting Portland Cement. SRPC is made by fusing together at high temperatures a precisely
