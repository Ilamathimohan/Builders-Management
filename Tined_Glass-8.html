        Tinted glass can be used to form a curtainwall, and is most often used in commercial applications, offices, and other large facilities.
        It is ideal for storefronts, atria, skylights, and also interior designs.The body-tinted glass is float glass in which melted colorants
        are added for tinting and solar-radiation absorption properties. This type of glass saves energy, reduces heat penetration into buildings 
        and gives a striking visual effect. Tinted glass is an important architectural element for the exterior appearance of facades.The 
        body-tinted glass is float glass in which melted colorants are added for tinting and solar-radiation absorption properties. This type 
        of glass saves energy, reduces heat penetration into buildings and gives a striking visual effect.Advantages of tinted glass –Tinted 
        glass is made by adding small amounts of metal oxide to the glass composition. This alters the transmission of solar energy and 
        modifies the colour without changing the basic properties of the glass. The process ultimately reduces the effects of sunlight which 
        can help protect interior and furnishings from damage.Energy efficiency,Sun protection,Improved security,Increased privacy,Low-
        maintenance. Tinted glass provides privacy and reduces the glare of the light entering the room, and provides a comfortable environment. 
        As they are available in various different colours, they provide striking visual effect and increase the architectural view of the 
        structure. Tinted glass can be used to form a curtainwall, and is most often used in commercial applications, offices, and other large 
        facilities. It is ideal for storefronts, atria, skylights, and also interior designs. Why is Glass Used in Construction? When used as 
        a construction material, glass is employed as a transparent glazing element in the building envelope. This includes windows in external 
        walls and internal partitions. Tinted glass means vehicle glass to which any film or other material or process has been applied to 
        darken or restrict the passage of light through vehicle glass. Window tinting works by using a specific type of polyester film with a 
        scratch-resistant coating. This film allows some types of light rays to pass through while absorbing or reflecting others. In the most 
        basic sense, window tinting refers to the process of applying a thin laminate film to your car's glass. Tinted glass, is made by 
        including colouring additives to normal clear glass during the manufacturing process. Majority of tinting is done with shades of 
        bronze, grey, blue or green. These tones of glass significantly reduce glare and heat gain from the sun. Body tinted glass products 
        are produced by small additions of metal oxides to the float or rolled glass composition. These small additions color the glass 
        bronze, green, blue or grey but do not affect the basic properties of the glass except for changes in the solar energy transmittance. 
        You can expect to pay between $99 – $850 or more for tint, which will vary depending on how many windows, type of tint, vehicle type, 
        and size of windows. Tinted glass is not allowed in India. The supreme court of India ruled in 2012 that tinted glasses and sun-films 
        are not to be used in cars. The ban on dark glasses came in on account of the crimes committed inside the cars. The main characteristics 
        of glass are transparency, heat resistance, pressure and breakage resistance and chemical resistance. The hardness of float glass is 
        established according to Knoop. The basis is the test method given in DIN 52333 (ISO 9385). This will slow down the drying time and 
        can make those window bubbles stick around even longer. But you can help your window tint dry faster by parking your vehicle in direct 
        sunlight, or inside the garage if it's snowing or raining. Glass that has been treated to produce a tint to the glass, reducing the 
        emission of heat from the sun as well as adding privacy due to the decrease in visual clarity.
