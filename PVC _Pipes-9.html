        Like many of the pipes on this list, PVC pipes are great for applications that require fluid transmission. Aside from this, they’re 
        also lightweight, flexible, and versatile in design. They can easily be modified in order to accommodate different pipe fittings that 
        may be needed. You’ll often spot PVC pipes in electrical wiring systems, specifically as electrical conduit pipes. They provide a 
        watertight and waterproof housing for electrical wires that may be exposed to external elements like high/low heat, pressure, and 
        debris, but they also have their disadvantages. To give an example: Their structuring can be easily warped and distorted in high-
        temperature environments, which can be difficult to avoid at times. PVC is the most used plastic material for building and 
        construction products such as pipes, cables, window profiles, flooring and roofing. PVC makes a major contribution to the quality, 
        safety and cost-effectiveness of construction materials, as well as contributing to lower environmental impacts of completed projects. 
        PVC pipes are commonly used for manufacturing sewage pipes, water mains and irrigation. Possessing very long-lasting properties, PVC 
        pipes are easy to install, lightweight, strong, durable and easily recyclable, making them cost-efficient and sustainable. PVC or 
        polyvinyl chloride is one of the most versatile choices for various applications in many areas, including construction industry. PVC 
        pipes are inherently strong, lightweight, flexible, easy to handle and economic. Along with all these qualities, their long-lifespan 
        and recyclability make them the prime economic option for residential as well as commercial building construction projects.Are you
