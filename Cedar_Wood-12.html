        Cedar wood tends to be used for its natural beauty, which means it isn't typically hidden in the framing of a construction project. 
        With this visual appeal, cedar lends itself to be used in many applications like fencing, decking, siding, and trim. The unique tones 
        and patterns of cedar make it a popular choice for adding a warm, durable, natural beauty to the exterior of homes as siding, eaves, 
        decking, soffits and fascia. Cedar Wood is a softwood with a spicy aroma and natural insect-repelling capabilities used for preparing 
        cedar oil, fencing, siding, boat building, musical instrument making, decking, high-quality furniture making, and many more. The Cedar 
        is not a wood of a specific species. Instead, Cedar contains 15 species of wood. They are very near to each other, and they are unique 
        in features of colour, hardness, and rot resistance. They are utilized based on their properties. Its dark colour, light-weight, and 
        soft texture make it more beautiful and demanding.It is utilized for fencing, decking, siding, and many other applications. Due to its 
        aromatic properties, It is also used for clothing storage and oil. It is famous all over the world. Cedar is one of the most attractive 
        and durable types of wood for house construction. It naturally resists damage from insects, moisture and temperature extremes. Most 
        houses are made of western red cedar, not the aromatic species used for closets, so there is no cedar smell in the house. Cedar and 
        birch are two types of popular woods and both have a variety of uses. Nevertheless, cedar is a softwood and birch a hardwood. 
        Regardless of how the term sounds, softwood is not weaker than hardwood, but can be less expensive. It is naturally rot and insect 
        resistant, so it is frequently used for outdoor applications, such as outdoor furniture, decking, and siding. However, cedar is also 
        frequently used to create indoor furniture like chests and tables, as it has a unique reddish hue and gives off a welcomed scent. 
        Cedar is more prone to cracking than most other species. Try to get the clearest cedar you can if you want to use it. Kiln dried if 
        possible. To fix cracks I like to mix sawdust from the board with glue or epoxy to get a good color match. Cedar wood is extremely 
        durable and holds up well to outdoor weather conditions. Because of its characteristics, cedar fencing will generally outlast fences 
        made from softer, less durable wood, such as pine. Due to its chemical properties, cedar is naturally weather-resistant and repels 
        most bugs. But over the years it can crack slightly and develop a fuzzy surface texture unless it's periodically refinished. Cedar 
        accepts sealers and stains beautifully and should be refinished every two to three years. As you can see densities of Cedar wood 
        species are low. This is why Cedar wood is lightweight and has an excellent strength-to-weight ratio. Its strength is significantly 
        according to the weight of the wood. Cedar comes from a large, coniferous evergreen tree. Cedar is generally a strong wood. Aromatic 
        Red Cedar has a compressive strength of 6,000 and a hardness of 900. Compare that to Chestnut wood (which is a Hardwood) has a 
        compressive strength of 5,300 and a hardness of 540. Walnut has a compressive strength of 7,500 and a hardness of 1,010. Cedar has a 
        reddish color, white accents, and unique grain pattern, making for a warm, rich-looking wood. Pine, by contrast, is lighter in color, 
        ranging from light brown to cream. Pine has to be pressure-treated so it can withstand the elements and wear and tear. True cedars 
        (and remember, that is all that we are discussing here!) hail from the mountains of the western Himalayas of Asia and the 
        Mediterranean region of Europe, where they are often found at high altitudes. Cedars are generally hardy to zone 6, although cedar of 
        Lebanon (Cedrus libani) is a bit more tender.
