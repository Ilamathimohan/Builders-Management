        Fly ash is a byproduct produced by coal-fired power plants that can contain toxic metals like mercury, arsenic, antinomy, and 
        chromium. Made using class C or class F fly ash, quicklime, cement, aluminum powder, gypsum, and water, fly ash bricks help to reuse 
        and reduce the amount of toxic metals released into the environment. They also have a more uniform shape than some bricks because of 
        their casting in a machine mold. These bricks have high compressive strength and low water absorption rate, so they are an excellent 
        alternative to burnt clay bricks. However, the durability of fly ash bricks decreases as the size of the brick increases, leading to
        cracks and fractures in fly ash slabs. For this reason, fly ash bricks typically come only in small sizes. The Fly Ash Brick is best
        for are strong, durable construction materials that can be used in place of burnt clay bricks, and they are made by reusing toxic metal
        byproducts from coal-fired power plants, helping to protect the environment by reducing toxic waste. Fly ash is a fine powder that is 
        a byproduct of burning pulverized coal in electric generation power plants. This residue, known as fly ash, is created when the mineral
        impurities in the coal fuse together as they come out of the combustion chamber, then cool down and harden. Fly ash is a pozzolan, a 
        substance containing aluminous and siliceous material that forms cement in the presence of water. When mixed with lime and water, fly 
        ash forms a compound similar to Portland cement. This makes fly ash suitable as a prime material in blended cement, mosaic tiles, and 
        hollow blocks, among other building materials. When used in concrete mixes, fly ash improves the strength and segregation of the 
        concrete and makes it easier to pump. Fly ash can be used as prime material in many cement-based products, such as poured concrete, 
        concrete block, and brick. One of the most common uses of fly ash is in Portland cement concrete pavement or PCC pavement. Road 
        construction projects using PCC can use a great deal of concrete, and substituting fly ash provides significant economic benefits. 
        Fly ash has also been used for embankment and mine fill, and it has increasingly gained acceptance by the Federal Highway 
        Administration.
